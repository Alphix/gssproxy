 - How to handle mixed proxied and non-proxied credentials for one
   process?

   Idea #0: Always use the proxy or no proxy.  Period.  Use an env var to
            select mechglue config.

   Idea #1: Some mechglue magic and minor constraints on the applications.

    - mechglue needs to allow multiple providers to provide same
      mechanisms, with GSS_Acquire/Add_cred*() trying all providers for
      the desired mechanism(s) in order till one works or all fail;

    - this does not work for GSS_Init/Accept_sec_context() when using
      the default credential;

       - for GSS_Init_sec_context() just pick one provider to be first
	 for default credential and let apps that want the other
	 provider acquire a credential handle instead of using the
	 default one (e.g., ssh -o GSSAPIInitiatorCredential=...);

       - for GSS_Accept_sec_context() declare that all acceptor
	 credentials for any given mechanism must be proxied or not;

   Idea #2: Use PGSS or GSS-APIv3 so we can have a caller context handle
            via which to specify mechglue configuration.

 - SPNEGO (any pseudo-mechanism) should not be proxied, as it will
   re-enter the mechglue and call the proxy(ies) if needed (or not) as
   appropriate.
